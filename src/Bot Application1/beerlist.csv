boon geuze mariage parfait|blond|10|0|2|hip|boongeuzemariageparfait.gif|"In the fifties, an extraordinary meeting took place that all beer enthusiasts should raise their glass of Leffe to. ? The abbey’s Father Abbot Nys became acquainted with Albert Lootvoet, a master brewer.? Passionate about the future of the brewery, Father Nys was upset to have to witness how, since the unpleasant stay of the French revolutionaries, the brewery had slowly fallen into decline and had eventually had to close its doors in 1809. Such a magnificent place could not be forgotten, he believed, and he vowed to bring the Leffe beer back. Father Nys and the brewer set about the challenge with vigour…and succeeded. Shortly after, the Leffe brewery was back in full effect. After Leffe Brown, a beer that shone brighter than the sun saw the light of day; they named it Leffe Blond – a beautiful chapter for Leffe indeed."
chimay blue|dark|30|2|0|classic|chimayblue.png|"Westmalle Dubbel is a dark| reddish-brown Trappist beer with a secondary fermentation in the bottle. The creamy head has the fragrance of special malt and leaves an attractive lace pattern in the glass. The flavour is rich and complex, herby and fruity with a fresh-bitter finish. It is a balanced quality beer with a soft feel in the mouth and a long, dry aftertaste. The Dubbel contains 7% alcohol."
chimay rouge|dark|24|2|0|classic|chimayrouge.png|"Was first brewed in 1934 and the recipe has not changed since 1956. It is made with pale candy sugar and has a very pale color produced from a mash of light pilsener malts. Styrian Goldings hops are used along with some German varieties and the classic Saaz pilsener hop. After a long secondary fermentation, the Tripel Westmalle is bottled with a dose of sugar and yeast. This beer holds up well in the bottle over time and seems to soften with age."
cornet|blond|20|1|0|hip|cornet.png|"As its name suggests| Pecheresse is a lambic beer enriched with peach juice. And this fruit lambic is a real peach! It is nice to drink at any time of day. Or on a sunny patio. Personally, I enjoy it with my girlfriends. And what we talk about is of no concern to you. A young lambic that is at least one year old, in which 30% filtrate of fresh peaches will macerate."
cristal alken|blond|17|0|0|smooth|cristalalken.png|"Liefmans Goudenband is one of the most distinctive dark beers in the world. Originally called IJzerenband (Iron Band) – a reference to the iron bands around the beer barrels – the bottle gained its champagne cork when it was renamed Liefmans Goudenband (Gold Band). Made in open vats with beer of mixed fermentation, it is left to mature for four to 12 months in the cellar. Mature beer is then fortified with younger beer, so the fermentation process starts up again."
delta ipa|amber|45|1|0|hip|deltaipa.jpg|"If blonds really do have more fun, imagine what they’d say about Vedett Extra Blond?! After all, who can resist her seductive straw colour and pearly-white head? Her smooth, malty character with subtly balanced hops? Or her lingering fruitiness with subtle notes of vanilla? Whatever your weakness, this premium pilsner offers full-bodied, thirst-quenching refreshment from start to finish. With a slightly bitter aftertaste to keep you on your toes"
duvel|blond|32|0|0|classic|duvel.png|"The inventors of Indian Pale Ale may have originally added extra hops to help it survive the long voyage to India. But we just do it for the taste! Every drop as thirst-quenching as the last, Vedett IPA offers an explosion of flavoursome bitterness that increases with intensity towards the finish, tempered by an unparalleled velvety smoothness resulting in a very accessible taste. Fresh| fruity and floral notes give way to touches of caramel sweetness| while its superb| lingering aftertaste continues to tantalise the tastebuds long after. Here’s to a great-tasting, refreshing beer!"

All that remains is to listen to the sound of contentment as you open the next bottle!"
hopus|blond|40|0|0|hip|hopus.png|"The Orval’s brewery produces only one beer to sell, a beer with a high fermentation that continues in the bottle. It is 6.2% ABV. This beer is brewed exclusively from spring water, barley malt, hop cones, candy sugar, and yeast. The aroma and the fine taste are due more to the hop cones and the yeast than to the malt that is used. What’s special about Orval’s beer is that hops are added at two different stages of the production process. First, in the brewing room, a large quantity of very fine hops are added – this produces the famous bitter taste and is the reason why the beer keeps for a longer period of time. Later| in the storage cellars, hops are once again added. This is the so-called British “dry hopping,” which produces the delightful aroma that completely enraptures even the most carefully forewarned taster."
lachouffe|blond|20|1|0|classic|lachouffe.png| Traditional Blond is a top-fermented beer refermented in the bottle. Caracterised with a fine fruity aroma with a subtle bitterness.
leffe blond|blond|20|2|0|classic|leffeblond.png|"Strong, Blond, Belgian. This 8.5% Vol. blond ale has lots of body and an oak flavour thanks to the oak touch during the lagering."
liefmans goudenband|darki|9|0|5|exclusive|liefmansgoudenband.png|"The glass in which De Koninck's flagship beer is served is called a bolleke, although this term is most colloquially used to refer to a glass filled with the beer itself and is the way the beer is ordered in bars."

lindemans kriek|fruit|10|5|2|summer|lindemanskriek.png|"With a self-confidend attitude, Delta stares straight at you with her golden eyes. The intensity of her exotic aromas will catch you by surprise, but it is her lingering bitterness that will leave you defenseless and make you surrender. Get away before it is too late, you really shouldn't trust her innocent look."
lindemans poecheresse|fruit|10|5|2|summer|lindemanspecheresse.png|"Blonde with copper reflections, topped with a generous head, Hopus derives from a secret batch brewed for the marriage of Paul Lefebvre. It has a unique and original nose, a blend of vegetal, citrus and fruit notes. The attack is bold| with an intense bitterness accompanied by a plethora of hopped notes. On the palate, the fruity top-fermented aromas and the malted flavours perfectly balance the initial taste without masking it. The bitter aftertaste is persistent but not disturbing, powerful but not overwhelming| elegant but not opulent…in short, the perfect preparation for the next mouthful. Drink very cold as an aperitif with crisps and pickles, as an accompaniment to a spicy dish or as an after-dinner digestive. Show Less"
macchouffe|dark|20|1|2|classic|macchouffe.png|"LA CHOUFFE is an unfiltered blonde beer, which is re-fermented in the bottle as well as in the keg. It is pleasantly fruity, spiced with coriander, and with a light hop taste."

rochefort 10|dark|27|2|0|classic|rochefort10.png|"Dominant impressions of latte coffee with powerful chocolate aromas in the nose. The alcohol esters are enveloped with hints of autumn wood, citrus zest (orange, lemon) and freshly baked biscuits. The initial taste is sweetly sinful. Beer and chocolate trapped into one single glass| a liquid milky draught with a backbone of bitter malt. The alcohol warms the throat and| in the finish, you will pick up traces of cloves, citrus, orange and mocha."
rochefort 6|dark|18|2|0|classic|rochefort6.png|"“This is the masterpiece of which I am most proud, as is one of my sons after whom it is named. What makes this traditional kriek special is that it is brewed with whole cherries. Since real Schaerbeek cherries are scarce, Lindemans Brewery has found their perfect equivalence elsewhere in Europe. It is deep red in colour and its foam head is slightly pink. Very refreshing, this beverage is a perfect thirst-quencher which, thanks to its fizzy and tangy flavour, is ideal as an aperitif.”"

vedett ipa|amber|40|1|0|summer|vedettipa.png|"Oude Geuze Boon is a monument of taste with an alcohol content of 7%. It’s a magnificent blend of 90% mild 18 month-old lambic, 5% strong 3 year-old beer and 5% very young lambic, which provides fermentable sugars and wild yeasts. All our beers are aged in oak casks, mixed in a vessel of 25.000 litres and chilled. Before bottling, we bring the mix to fermentation temperature. The bottles are then placed in an air-conditioned room, which leads to a secondary fermentation in the bottle. This is when the lambic becomes gueuze. After several months of aging in the bottle, the gueuze develops its delicate flavour. Want to know the bottling date? Simply subtract 20 years from the “best before” date!"
vedett pils|blond|17|0|0|hip|vedettpils.png|Duvel Tripel Hop is brewed with three hop varieties and each year the third hop is changed to provide its own unique taste and aroma. This keeps the final flavor profile surprisingly exciting for any true beer lover.

westmalle tripel|blond|36|1|0|classic|westmalletripel.png|"Topped with a creamy head, it gives off a light, fruity apricot aroma produced by the fermentation. The taste perceived in the mouth is a balance confirming the fruity nuances noticed in the fragrance.  Its taste, which imparts a silky sensation to the tongue, is made refreshing by a light touch of bitterness. To the palate, the taster perceives a pleasant astringency which complements the flavor qualities of this beer very harmoniously."
